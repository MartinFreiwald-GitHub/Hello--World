1) What is regex and when would we use it in a script?
   A Basic Regular Expression engine that comes with Java, python, Perl along wtih Linux operating system programs such as grep, Sed & 
   Awk.  Provides the expression as given in a statement message using one of the program languges or Linux programs such as Sed.  We can use 
   regex in a script to repeat a message from a string statement.  If you would use a loop program in our script to direct a string statement 
   as the output to another editor or to a GUI graphical user interface. 
   
2) What is a for loop?
   A For loop will loop through a number of writen for statements that are strings on each line of the for loop program.  If any of the string values
   are matched by the input to the for loop.  The program that uses the for loop will use the matched string from the for loop.  Then carry out 
   the rest of the program.
   
3) What is a while loop?
   While loop has a condition that is where the statement of values must be met.  For the condtion that is stated.  If the conditon of the while 
   loop is not met and so it is say false.  Then the loop stops.  The loop uses the condition that is given by the programer to decide if a value is 
   met then it is true.  If a value is not met it is false.  The body of the block that is below the condtion.  Will state values that if true from 
   the condition will add the block values to the true condition and loop those while. New data can enter the condition stage.  If the condition of 
   the new data is true.  It will be added to the blocks current data values and looped.  Untill the false condition is met.  
   
4) What is an 'if' statement?
   "if" statement evaluates the test expression inside the parnethesis.  Any statement(s) within the parnethesis that are matched.  Will executed 
    as the standard output or standard input from the programs use of the if statement to toggel additonal messageing for the matched values.
    Can be used for error messaging when programming to do so.
